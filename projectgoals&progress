The goal of this group project is to build a raspberry pi supercomputer with four nodes. Each member of the group will do some research on how to prepare the supercomputer and will contribute to assembling it. 
research: we will need 4 raspberry pi's. we will then need to assemble them so that they are all sitting on top of each other. We will have to connect each one to an ethernet switch and to power. In the following steps raspbian will need to be installed on four different micro SD cards (one for each raspberry pi). after inserting the micro SD cards, we must obtain the IP address.
